# PacMen
This app tracks a specific bus line in Boston, MA. Every 15 seconds you get an updated location of the buses. If you want to use this app, first you'd have to sign up for Google Maps API, get a unique key for you then add it in the proper section of the index.html file. 


## Running & Installation

Click the Add PacMen button to add as many Pacmen as you like.

## Road Map of Future Improvements
